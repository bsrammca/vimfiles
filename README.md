Vim files!
----------

    git clone http://github.com/rstacruz/vimfiles.git ~/.vim
    cd ~/.vim
    rake setup

This is my Vim setup which is managed by [Vundle][vundle]. You may not like my setup,
but you may want to build from this skeleton. I've set this repo up in the 
cleanest way I can, just look at `vimrc.vim` :D
